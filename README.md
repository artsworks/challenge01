# Quick Project using Angular Seed

This project has been quickly bootstrapped using Angular Seed.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply run:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  view2/                --> the view2 view template and logic
    view2.html            --> the partial template
    view2.js              --> the controller logic
    view2_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the `angular-seed` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

The `angular-seed` app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* The configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.
* The end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`.

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can
interact with it.

**Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run:**

```
npm start
```

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running, you
can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.

**Note:**
Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires
the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
`java -version` from the command line.

If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].
